#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Ancil Cleetus from Kerala, India.
#### I have a formal academic background in Electronics with a Post Graduate Degree in VLSI and Embedded Systems.
#### After working as a Hardware Design Engineer, Verification Engineer and Product Researcher in the Electronics Design field, I made a switch to the field of Artificial Intelligence in March 2021.
#### Since I don't have a formal Computer Science background, I know that I have a lot to learn. I have to make a solid foundation in Computer Science in general and Artificial Intelligence in particular.
#### Under the Foundations of Computer Science, I'm currently focusing on Data Structures & Algorithms and Programming Languages - C, C++, Python.
#### After finishing the above, I want to focus on more advanced areas like Game Theory, Automated Planning etc. I also want to learn more Programming Languages like Java, Rust, Go, Julia etc.
#### Under the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, I'm currently focusing on Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
#### After finishing the above, I want to focus on areas like Natural Language Processing, Self Supervised Learning etc.
#### In the future, I also want to focus on Quantum Machine Learning.
