Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ancil Cleetus from Kerala, India.

I have a formal academic background in Electronics with a Post Graduate Degree in VLSI and Embedded Systems.

After working in the field of Electronics Design as a Hardware Design Engineer, Verification Engineer and Product Researcher, I made a switch to the field of Artificial Intelligence in March 2021.

Since I don't have a formal Computer Science background, I know that I have a lot to learn. I have to make a solid foundation in Computer Science in general and Artificial Intelligence in particular.

Under the Foundations of Computer Science, I'm currently focusing on Data Structures & Algorithms and Programming Languages - C, C++, Python.
After building a strong foundation in above areas, I want to focus on more advanced areas like Game Theory, Automated Planning etc. I also want to learn more Programming Languages like Java, Go, Rust, Julia etc.

Under the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, I'm currently focusing on Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
In the future, I want to focus on Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Self Supervised Learning etc.

In the future, I also want to focus on Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning.

I'm documenting my Learning Journey through my GitHub repos whenever I get spare time.
